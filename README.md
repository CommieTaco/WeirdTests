# WeirdTests
Uuuuh... I don't really know why or how I did this, just was trying some JS stuff and ended up with this, feel free to try.
It's a webpage for you to draw on a canvas, you can choose the Background color of the canvas, or you can choose from some "interesting" images as background.
Also, you can use the keyboard or mouse to draw.

Please, if you think something can make this thing even more weird, feel free to contact :)
